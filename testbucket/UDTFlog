Issue: Select UDF statement does not return results after running for many minutes and the query has an error message as SQL execution canceled in the query history page.
Root cause: Having ENABLE_USER_LOGGER parameter set to true
Solution: Details of the issue are captured in this Jira - https://snowflakecomputing.atlassian.net/browse/SNOW-683840
If the customer account is using Event Table logging framework, then they might have these values set to true:
ENABLE_USER_LOGGER = true
ENABLE_EVENT_TABLES= true
The recommendation is to have ENABLE_PYTHON_UDF_LOGGING= true.  If the customer is also using Python UDTF, then ENABLE_PYTHON_UDTF_EVENT_LOGGING should also be set to true. Note: Per Engineering, this will be resolved once event logging goes into PuPr.
